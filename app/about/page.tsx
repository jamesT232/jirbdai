              <strong>JIRBDAI</strong> is a new academic multidisciplinary
              journal covering a range of subjects in Information and
              Communications Technologies, Computing, Innovative Technologies,
              Management Sciences, Big Data Analytics, Enterprise and Management
              Innovation and eBusiness, Decision Science, and Financial
              Management. The main objective of <strong>JIRBDAI</strong> is to
              provide an intellectual platform for Baze University, regional and
              international scholars. <strong>JIRBDAI</strong> aims to promote
              interdisciplinary studies in science and technology and become one
              of the leading journals in the area. Because its multidisciplinary
              framework covers a large research community in an innovative
              public peer review process, thus accessing top-quality papers
              across disciplines. In addition, the regional coverage of the
              journal extends beyond one geographical region, which further
              enhances its reach in terms of attracting high-quality
              contributions. The journal will publish original research and
              papers discussing, analysing, or evaluating policies or disclosing
              relevant gaps in existing research.
            </p>
